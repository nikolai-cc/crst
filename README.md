# ü•ê crst: css reset

`crst` (pronounced: croissant) obliterates default browser css styles in order to start with a (consistent) clean sheet when writing your own styles.

It's inspired by various similar projects:

-   [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
-   [Modern Normalize](https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize)
-   [The New CSS Reset](https://elad2412.github.io/the-new-css-reset/)

‚ö†Ô∏è It's imperative to use this as a _starting point_ for designing your own styles, unless you hate your users.

## Getting started

to install:

```
npm i crst
```

then include somewhere in :

```
import "crst/reset.css";
```

or [download reset.css]()

and include it before your projects styles

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/reset.css" type="text/css">
```
